### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

-  Iâ€™m currently working on various coding projects associated with my Master's program in Mathematics. 
   I am mostly working on projects in mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, machine learning, and neural networks. 
   I will use this repository to showcase the projects I'm currently working on. 
- I'm currently looking for entry level roles in Data Science when I graduate in May 2024.
