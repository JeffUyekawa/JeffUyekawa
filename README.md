### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**JeffUyekawa/JeffUyekawa** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->
-  Iâ€™m currently working on various coding projects associated with my Master's program in Mathematics. 
   I am mostly working on projects in mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, machine learning, and neural networks. 
   I will use this repository to showcase the projects I'm currently working on. 
- I'm currently looking for internships for Summer 2023 in Data Science, Machine Learning, or Mathematical Modeling roles
- How to reach me: jeffuyekawa@gmail.com
